    Vital for this project is the following api of the framework that I used.
    http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-0/#!/guide
    
    There are plenty of examples that allow you to learn quickly:

    The forum is also a popular place to ask questions. 
    Usually they are answered within hours, sometimes a few days.
    If you purchase a license that includes a premium forum membership, you can be
    sure that no question stays unanswered. The response time is usually very good.

    Glossary, a key term in the entire project is prisma. A prisma is a 
    preferred reporting item for systematic analysis and is basically 
    the key terms such as intervention and outcomes which are required for an
    abstract. The user adds them into a list and they are populated into 
    the abstract.
